   Welcome to the Liam5_1 program
   This program will control your mower and relies on a two coil
   configuration (0 and 1) with an optional (2).

   The mower is assumed to be rear wheel driven and have three
   boundary wire reciever coils in the following configuration

    wheel
    ----------------
   |      (0) |
   |(2)           |  ----> Mowing direction
   |      (1) |
    ----------------
  wheel

  Most of the default values for your mower can be set in the
  Definition.h file. Use this to configure your mower for best
  performance.
